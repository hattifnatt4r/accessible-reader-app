A small web app I made for my friend to help improve reading/writing skills - the app is aimed for kids with vision and motor skills limitations (eg cerebral palsy). 
Features:

- highlight and narrate text by word/sentence/paragraph
- edit selected text with special keyboard 
- change font size and keyboard design
- create interactive notebooks for learning (*in development)

The app has large easy-to-click buttons, large adjustable font size.
